## 🎓 Getting Started
Deep reinforcement learning combines deep learning with reinforcement learning, allowing agents to learn how to make sequences of decisions from raw sensory input. This repository offers code for several well-known DRL algorithms. The goal is to provide accessible implementations that are easy to integrate, experiment with, and use as a reference for research and educational projects.

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented
The following algorithms are currently implemented:
- **DQN (Deep Q-Network)**
- **DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)**
- **A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)**
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**
- **SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)**
- **TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG)**

Each algorithm includes a separate module that can be run and modified independently.

## 📦 Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-reinforcement-learning-algorithms.git
cd deep-reinforcement-learning-algorithms
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: This codebase requires Python 3.8+ and has been tested with PyTorch 1.8+ and Gym 0.26+.

## ⚙️ Usage
To start training an agent, select the desired algorithm and environment. 

### Running a DQN Agent on LunarLander
```bash
python train.py --algorithm DQN --env LunarLander-v2
```

### Training Options
You can configure hyperparameters and other settings via command-line arguments. For example:
```bash
python train.py --algorithm PPO --env CartPole-v1 --learning_rate 0.0003 --batch_size 64
```

For more details on command-line arguments, refer to the [CLI Options](#cli-options) section.

## 📊 Results & Visualization
Each training run logs data for rewards, loss, and other metrics. These can be visualized using tools like TensorBoard.

1. **TensorBoard**:
   ```bash
   tensorboard --logdir runs
   ```

2. **Video Rendering**: Episodes are recorded (if enabled) and saved in the `videos/` folder, so you can watch the agent’s performance.

3. **Sample Output**: Below is a sample performance graph of PPO on CartPole-v1:
